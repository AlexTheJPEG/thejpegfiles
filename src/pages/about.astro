            Hey there! I'm Alex, just a random guy on planet Earth currently pursuing a Masters in Computer Science. I
            like to partake in coding, gaming, watching anime, reading manga, listening to music, playing the piano, and
            trying to be funny on the Internet. I also make stupid stick figure drawings sometimes. Once I'm unbound by
            the shackles of academia, I'll also make YouTube videos / livestreams.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-4 text-lg text-slate-500 dark:text-slate-400">
            On this site, you'll find anything that I feel like I want to share with the world, whether that'd be
            linking cool stuff I found, ranting about technology not working, talking about a game I've played or show
            I've watched, or anything else, really.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-4 text-lg font-bold text-slate-500 dark:text-slate-400">
            My internet presence is a safe space for people of any race, ethnicity, gender, and sexuality. Do not
            interact with me if you discriminate based on these traits.
        </p>
