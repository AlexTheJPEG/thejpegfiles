            Hey there! I'm Alex, just a random guy on planet Earth that partakes in 
            coding, gaming, watching anime, reading manga, listening to music, playing 
            the piano, and trying to be funny on the Internet. I also make stupid stick
            figure drawings sometimes. Once I'm unbound by the shackles of academia,
            I'll also make YouTube videos / livestreams.

            On this site, you'll find anything that I feel like I want to share with
            the world, whether that'd be linking cool stuff I found, ranting about
            technology not working, talking about a game I've played or show I've watched,
            or anything else, really.

                    I'm a CS major, so of course I'm surrounded by technology for most of my waking hours. I'm most comfortable
                    with the Python programming language, although I also have experience with Java and C/C++ for school, and
                    I know a little bit of Rust because I thought it would be interesting to learn. I'm also trying to get the
                    hang of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (I mean, I made this website...that's gotta count for something right?).
                    I also learned Docker and networking by maintaining a small homelab on a Lenovo Thinkcentre.

                <p class="mb-4">
                    I also have a good amount of experience with Linux. I actually used to daily drive Linux for a bit, but I 
                    had to switch back to Windows for work and school reasons. My gaming PC at home and my main laptop use 
                    Windows, and I have a spare laptop that runs Arch (btw) to fulfill my tinkering needs. (I'll fully switch 
                    to Linux one day...one day...)

                    Gaming is one of my favorite pastimes. My PC is my preferred way to game, but I also have a Steam Deck and
                    Nintendo Switch to play games on the go. At home, I keep my Wii U and PS3 in my room. I used to have an original
                    Wii, which was my childhood console, before I gave it away to a local after-school camp.

                    I'm still trying to play through the many games I bought on Steam and the free games of the week I grabbed on Epic...

                    I actually only started watching anime relatively recently. About a few months before the COVID-19 quarantine,
                    I started JoJo's Bizarre Adventure because I wanted to get the "jojo references" my friends were making. Then
                    I explored other shows like My Hero Academia and Dr. Stone on a whim, and before I knew it, I found a new love
                    for anime. There's still so many shows everyone talks about that I have yet to watch...
                </p>
                <p class="mb-4">
                    I also catch up with some manga and webtoons. Recently, I started buying physical manga for a couple series that
                    I have a personal connection with.

                    Music has been and always will be a huge part of my life. I played the piano since I was four (still playing!),
                    and I played the violin for middle and high school. I also listen to music a lot when I'm going on walks,
                    sitting in the car, studying, playing games, etc. My usual playlist contains video game OSTs, EDM, and anime
                    OPs / EDs, but I also listen to classical music / lo-fi hip hop when I need to lock in for work. I'm also in
                    a Spotify blend playlist with my friends whenever I want to listen to something new.
